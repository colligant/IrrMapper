      <abstract>The Department of Revenue Final Land Unit Classification (FLU) is a classification of private agricultural land into one of six uses, fallow, hay, grazing, irrigated, continuously cropped and forest, with forest additionally classified as commercial or non-commercial and irrigated land classified as being flood, pivot, or sprinkler. This layer contains forested land and agricultural land that was not classified as grazing. The data are used in property valuation for agriculture and forest land on private properties. FLU data may exist in tax-exempt or public land, but no effort has been made to significantly edit, adjust, delete or enhance data to private parcel standards in exempt parcels.

Linework was digitized, edited and updated by DOR GIS Technicians.  NAIP 2005 imagery was the primary source used to delineate the features.  NAIP 2006 where available, NAIP Infrared 2005 imagery, 1999-2003 Black and White DOQQ, USGS DRG, and DOR agriculture information and documentation were used as secondary sources.

Using photo interpretation, DOR Technicians attributed each linework polygon based one of the 6 uses mentioned above.  During the summer of 2006 and 2007, DOR Agriculture Appraisers field checked much of the linework and classifications.  Discrepancies are documented on hardcopy maps used in the field check effort.  The data was then updated based on feedback from the field check.

In early 2009, all agriculture producers who own private parcels in the state were mailed maps of their parcels ag/forest use with instructions to return maps that were incorrectly classified.  DOR GIS Techs updated the database based on the feedback from landowners, DOR Appraisers discovering classification changes during field work and/or analysis of new imagery where available.

Since 2010 the data continues to be actively updated on an yearly basis using the most current NAIP imagery available and/or per land classification change requests from landowners and DOR county ag and forest appraisal staff.  The data changes are completed by DOR GIS staff assigned to maintain specific counties.  Typically, there are land classification changes on between 3,000 to 5,000 geocoded parcels each year.

In 2010, a new classification was implemented, the "X" attribute.  This classification/attribute is used for larger commercial operations such as gravel pits, golf courses, mines, etc.  The delineation of a commercial features is requested by DOR county appraisers who wish to more accurately calculate certain classification acres on a parcel for certain property valuation situations.  The features are digitized via photo interpretation using NAIP imagery and in consolation of DOR appraisers.</abstract>
      <purpose>The Department of Revenue Agriculture and Forest Final Land Unit Classification data (FLU) is used for property valuation for agriculture and forest land on private properties in Montana.  The data is used with the NRCS SURRGO and NASIS soil databases, a DOR GIS dataset of forest productivity and the Department of Revenue statewide cadastral GIS databases to determine productivity for agriculture and forest land on priviate parcels</purpose>

            <edomvd>Summer fallow farmland, a method of farming in arid and semi-arid areas without using irrigation which consists of cultivating a given area in alternate years (usually every other year), allowing moisture to be stored in the un-cropped (fallow) year.

Even if grain crops are occasionally sequenced with alfalfa or other nitrogen fixing crops, the land will be classified as fallow if grain is the principle crop.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Continuously cropped, a method of farming without irrigation in which crops are grown a majority of the time as part of a normal farming practice.  Christmas tree plantation and fruit orchards are classified as continuously cropped farmland.  There are wheat fields in northwest Montana also classified as continuously cropped.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Non-irrigated hay land, method of farming whereby hay is cut a majority of the years. Native vegetation cut for hay yearly or majority of the time over a period of years.  Non-irrigated alfalfa and other domestic varieties cut for hay yearly or the majority of the time</edomvd>
          </edom>
          <edom>
            <edomv>I</edomv>
            <edomvd>Irrigated land, a method of farming that uses man-made water delivery systems to apply water to hayland or cropland to increase production.  All hay land and cropland that is irrigated a majority of the time over the long term (2 out of 3 years, 3 out of 5 years, 4 out of 7 years, etc.)

All agricultural land, including grazing land in a specified irrigation district where the land is designated as irrigable with shares of the water appurtenant to such land shall be classified as irrigated, regardless whether the water is actually applied or not applied to the land.

Land in an irrigation district that is not designated as irrigable by the district and is not charged an irrigation fee, is classified according to its current use.

Land that has water available for irrigation most years is classified as irrigated if the water is used.

Land that has water for irrigation most years, but the water is not utilized, is not classified as irrigated.  These lands are classified according to their current use.</edomvd>

            <edomv>T</edomv>
            <edomvd>Forest land, defined by statue as contiguous land of 15 acres or more in one ownership that is capable of producing timber that can be harvested in commercial quantity and is producing timber unless the trees have been removed by disaster.

Commercial means forest land that exceeds 15 contiguous acres of timber capable of producing 100 board feet/acre/year of commercially usable wood.  Strips of forest less than 120 feet in width are nonforest.

Covenants restricting timber harvesting preclude forest land classification, however conservation easements do not.</edomvd>

            <edomv>N</edomv>
            <edomvd>Noncommercial forest land due to species type (ie., aspen, cottonwood, juniper, limber pine, etc)

Forested land that does not meet the minimum forest productivity requirement (currently 100 board feet/acre/year) is also considered non-commercial forest.  Non-commercial forestland due to productivity, is determined in subsequent processes and not part of this dataset.

Forest land means land that includes commercial forest land that is at least 10 percent stocked by trees of any size and capable of producing timber or other wood products.  Land in which the timber has been harvested below 10 percent stocking, but forest growth will regenerate within seven years.</edomvd>
